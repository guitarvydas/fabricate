### Normalization - Boringness

- same thing happened in days of Assembler, pre-HLL - assembler programmers wrote "smart" code that was varied and not normalized
	- this discouraged automated code generation - too many options / variations
- normalization (boringness) makes it easier to generate code
- boring code can be optimized - automatically - later, e.g. using peepholing techniques
